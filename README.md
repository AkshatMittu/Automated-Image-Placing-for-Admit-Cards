# Photo-Signature-Detection
This was a SIH-2022 project to detect signatures and photos to avoid problems while generating admit cards or other similar documents

## Project:
This project aims to classify the documents uploaded by the user in an application portal, many mistakes are done while uploading the documents in the portal and this causes trouble to generate the related admit cards, reports, etc.
This application recognizes the documents uploaded and places them in the right field in the application. In this way, the problems caused during uploading can be avoided

## Result:
The application worked with 99% accuracy and was able to place the documents in the right field

## Methodologies:
Convolution Neural Networks, Transfer Learning Models were used to build this project
